## What is Capitalism?

Capitalism is an economic system where trade, industry, and the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for profit. In capitalism, capital (money or other assets) is invested with the aim of generating returns, with markets primarily guiding production and distribution.

## Before Capitalism

Before capitalism, most economies were structured around feudalism (up to the 15th century in Europe). Under feudalism, land was the main source of wealth, controlled by nobles, and labor was provided by serfs bound to the land. Production was for subsistence rather than profit, with little to no focus on market-based exchange.

## Origins and Timeline of Capitalism

-   Early 16th to 18th Century: Proto-capitalist structures began emerging with the Commercial Revolution in Europe. Trade expanded, and early banking and joint-stock companies were created, laying the groundwork for capitalism.

-   Late 18th Century: Capitalism as we recognize it took root with the Industrial Revolution (starting around the 1760s in Britain). This period saw significant technological advancements and mechanization, leading to mass production and factory systems.

-   1776: Adam Smith’s seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, was published, advocating for free markets and explaining productivity gains from the division of labor. Smith’s pin factory example demonstrated how dividing tasks increased output significantly.

## Division of Labor

In the pin factory example, Smith describes how dividing the production of pins into specialized tasks allowed workers to produce thousands of pins per day, compared to the few they could make individually. This concept became a foundational element of capitalist production, emphasizing efficiency and specialization to maximize profit.
