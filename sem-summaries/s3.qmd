## Highlights

-   Successfully joined the MIT Tech Masters swimming team!!! I now swim at least once a week and have improved a lot! Great for my fitness and my health!

-   Completed three econ classes (public econ, microeconomics and stat methods) and made lots of friends in the process. This was my first semester w full control over my subjects and my favourite yet. Teachers were great and I went to lots of office hours (something I didn't always do in the past). After having not taken econ classes in many, many years, these classes were not easy. I'm super satisfied I got through them.

-   Other:

    -   Made friends w Kathy, my freshman, micro study buddy

    -   Made friends w Christine, Arianna and Ashley, my stats study buddies

    -   Transition to ipad note taking from pen and paper!! (the undergrads have inspired me)
