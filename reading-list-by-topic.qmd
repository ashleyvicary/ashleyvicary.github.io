## Summary

The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is a popular statistical approach for
estimating the global ranking of a collection of items using pairwise
comparisons. To ensure accurate ranking, it is essential to obtain precise
estimates of the model parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss. The difficulty
of this task depends crucially on the topology of the pairwise comparison graph
over the given items. However, beyond very few well-studied cases, such as the
complete and Erdös-Rényi comparison graphs, little is known about the
performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the BTL model
parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss under more general graph topologies.
In this paper, we derive novel, general upper bounds on the ℓ∞ estimation error
of the BTL MLE that depend explicitly on the algebraic connectivity of the
comparison graph, the maximal performance gap across items and the sample
complexity. We demonstrate that the derived bounds perform well and in some
cases are sharper compared to known results obtained using different loss
functions and more restricted assumptions and graph topologies. We carefully
compare our results to `Yan et al. (2012)`, which is closest in spirit to our
work. We further provide minimax lower bounds under $\ell_{\infty}$-error that 
nearly match the upper bounds over a class of sufficiently regular graph
topologies. Finally, we study the implications of our $\ell_{\infty}$-bounds 
for efficient (offline) tournament design. We illustrate and discuss our 
findings through various examples and simulations.
